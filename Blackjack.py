#FOR PART II:
#The best strategy, provided the dealer's behaviour, is:
    # always hit if he is higher than us and will stay
    # stand if we are higher than him
    # in the other cases (he is higher than us and will hit) hit only if the probability
    # to beat him is higher than the probability of losing being lower or being busted.
    # Infact, if we are lower but we could lose and he will hit, it's better to wait
    # and let him play: he would also be more likely to lose than winning. Otherwise, this
    # means that he has arrived over 16 and we need to hit as much as possible to beat him.
